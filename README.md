# Documentation

[![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pnnl-atlas/badge/?version=latest)](http://pnnl-atlas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

# Install

All dependencies are installed via [conda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) using the [bioconda](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes) channel.
The workflow and some dependencies require Python 3.

The intended usage requires `conda`.

Further dependencies will be installed on the first execution of the assembly
or annotation protocol and re-used on subsequent executions of the protocols.

For more information related to bioconda, see: https://bioconda.github.io/

## As a New Environment

With `conda`, execute:

```
conda create -n atlas -c bioconda python>=3.6 \
    snakemake bbmap=37.78 click ruamel.yaml
```

Load the environment:

```
source activate atlas
```

Install `atlas`:

```
pip install -U pnnl-atlas
```

## In the Same Environment

```
conda install -c bioconda python>=3.6 \
    snakemake bbmap=37.78 click ruamel.yaml
pip install -U pnnl-atlas
```

# Getting Started

After installing, one needs to download the required databases and create a sample configuration file.


## Databases

To download the databases and their respective metadata databases:

```
atlas download -o ~/databases
```

The downloads use approximately 40 GB of disk space.


## Configuration File

To create a configuration file run:

```
atlas make-config --database-dir ~/databases \
    config.yaml ~/directory_with_fastqs
```

Sample names and file paths along with default settings will populate
config.yaml. This [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/start.html) file can be updated
with any text editor.

Sample names should be A-Z characters and can be dash ("-") delimited.

## Assembly

After editing your configuration file and adjusting any additional parameters
we run assemblies across our samples using:

```
atlas assemble config.yaml
```

By default, this will write results into our current working directory across
the total number of CPU cores available.
